# Analytics on cycle_hire

As working with BigQuery and analyzing databases, I find `cycle_hire` from from London Bicycle Hires on BigQuery

> This data contains the number of hires of London's Santander Cycle Hire Scheme from 2011 to present. Data includes start and stop timestamps, station names and ride duration. for more detail see [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery(cameo:product/greater-london-authority/london-bicycles)?project=my-project-341411)


For understand better the dataset, There are some question that I've answered them with SQL. Here is:

- [] how many bike trips lasted for 20 minutes or longer?
- [] What are the names of the stations that bike_id 1710 started from?
- [] How many bike_ids have ended at "Moor Street, Soho"?
- [] What is the station_id for "Canton Street, Poplar"?
- [] What is the name of the station whose ID is 111?
- [] How many distinct bike_ids had trip durations greater than 2400 seconds (or 40 minutes)?
